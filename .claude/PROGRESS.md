# Current state

**Goal:** Media library app — feature work plus the repo-wide audit fixes.
**Branch:** claude/repository-overview-FcVyQ
**Updated:** 2026-08-18 — commit `d6aa68b`

## Done

- [x] Finances section — budget, expenses (10 categories), additional income, carryover, TRY currency
- [x] Recurring subscriptions — per-issue billing, cancel-from-next-month
- [x] Comics restructured into Publisher → Universe → Title → Issue (real FKs, cascade deletes)
- [x] Per-issue reread tracking; reading time counts every pass, not every issue
- [x] Audit Phase 1 — security: Next 16.2.3 → 16.3.1 (6 middleware-bypass advisories),
      upload path-traversal closed, image `remotePatterns` narrowed, signed HMAC session token,
      401 JSON for `/api/*`, logout, login rate limit, open-redirect fix
- [x] Audit Phase 2 — correctness: dead "Time Remaining" stat, edit forms can clear fields,
      filter params validated (400 not 500)
- [x] Audit Phase 3 — performance: cover-mosaic preload storm removed, list-page over-fetching,
      17 components off the client bundle, steam-sync N+1 batched, index gaps
- [x] Audit Phase 4 — robustness: `withErrors` on route handlers, db connection guard,
      finance caching made real
- [x] Audit Phase 5/6 — shared form helpers, label `htmlFor`, ESLint + lint/typecheck scripts
- [x] Verified idempotent SQL migration at `prisma/manual-migrations/001-…sql`
- [x] RLS enabled on all public tables (closes the Supabase REST API to the anon key)
- [x] Cross-session resume — `.claude/PROGRESS.md` + SessionStart hook
- [x] **Mobile expense logger (PWA)** — `/finances/log`, installable to the iOS home screen,
      offline queue in IndexedDB, idempotent sync. Verified end-to-end against a real
      Postgres + Chromium: 10/10 browser checks, and duplicate-free in the database.

- [x] **Auto-derived status** for Books/TV/Anime/Manga — computed from progress counts on every
      write, status dropdown removed, Dropped/On Hold/DNF deleted. Books gained `pagesRead`,
      manga gained a *still releasing* flag. 127 unit assertions + 11 database-level API checks.

## Next

Three items were scoped in the audit but not implemented. In rough value order:

- [ ] **Trigram search indexes.** Every list page searches with `contains` → `ILIKE '%q%'`,
      which no btree can serve, so each search is a full sequential scan. Needs
      `CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm` plus a GIN index per searched column. Requires a SQL script
      in `prisma/manual-migrations/` since `db push` can't reach this database.
- [ ] **`next/image` on the 8 remaining detail pages** (`app/library/*/[id]/page.tsx` and
      `app/wardrobe/[id]/page.tsx`). These are the largest images on the site and the only ones
      still unoptimised — no resizing, no AVIF/WebP, no lazy loading, CLS on every load.
      The card components were migrated already; copy that pattern.
- [ ] **`aria-label`s on icon-only controls.** Only 3 exist. lucide auto-applies
      `aria-hidden` to childless icons, so an icon-only button/link has an empty accessible
      name. Sweep `components/` for buttons and links whose only child is an icon.

## Blocked / needs the user

- **Run `prisma/manual-migrations/003-derived-status.sql`** — until then the app expects enum
  values and columns the database does not have yet, so Books/TV/Anime/Manga writes will fail.
  It aborts harmlessly if any row still uses DROPPED/ON_HOLD/DNF.
- **Run `prisma/manual-migrations/002-expense-idempotency.sql`** in the Supabase SQL Editor.
  Until it is applied, the expense logger's retry path can create duplicate expenses.
- Provide the production URL so exact install instructions can be given (it is recorded
  nowhere in the repo).
- `001-comics-hierarchy-and-indexes.sql` and the RLS block have both been run already.
- Any *future* schema change needs the same treatment: `prisma db push` cannot reach this
  Supabase instance, so write an idempotent script into `prisma/manual-migrations/` and ask the
  user to paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor. Do not assume it has been run — confirm.

## Notes for the next session

- The expense logger's duplicate bug was only visible by checking the **database**, not the UI —
  the browser tests all passed while Postgres held 4 rows for 3 expenses. Assert against the data
  store, not just the screen.
- A client-side lock cannot prevent duplicate submissions across page contexts (two tabs, or a
  navigation racing the `online` event). Idempotency has to be enforced server-side.

- **The container is wiped between sessions.** `node_modules/` will be gone; the session-start
  hook reinstalls it. Anything not committed is lost.
- `npm run build` is the real gate — `tsc --noEmit` alone misses Next-specific failures like a
  client component importing something that pulls in `lib/db` (and therefore `pg`).
- 3 npm advisories remain, all in the Prisma **CLI** (`@prisma/config` → `deepmerge-ts`).
  Fixing needs `--force`. `prisma` is a devDependency, so none of it reaches production.
- The user often works from an iPad — prefer pasting SQL and commands directly into chat over
  linking to repo paths they'd have to go open.
